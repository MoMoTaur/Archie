# archie
A lightweight, portable, and performance-driven library providing geometry as well as many helpful mathematical formulas with floating-point precision.


Archie is to be a simple library containing some basic geometry and otherwise useful
mathematical constructs and functions that can be performed on those. It is not, nor will
it ever be a physics library, a game engine, or anything of the sort. Archie's sole
purpose is to contain basic mathematical functions. What you do with it afterwards is up
to you.

With that out of the way, I hope you enjoy Archie, and I hope you find it as useful as I
do!
