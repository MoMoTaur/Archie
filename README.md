# archie
A lightweight, portable, and performance-driven library written in C that
provides geometry, collision detection, vector math, and many more helpful
mathematical formulas and constructs with accuracy to several decimal places.


Archie is to be a simple library containing some basic geometry and otherwise
useful mathematical constructs and functions that can be performed on those.
Archie's purpose is to be a solid foundation on which to build upon for
projects that require precision and performance.

With that out of the way, I hope you enjoy Archie, and I hope you find it as
useful as I do!
