This file contains the rules for the tasklist.txt file for the Archie Library.

The syntax is as follows:
Author Name:		The name of the person who suggested this task or suggestion
Brief explanation:	Just what it says, a brief explanation. Keep it down to a
					single line (without wrapping to a new line, like this)
Files Concerned:	Any files where one could find the topic of the task/suggest
Longer Explanation:	A longer explanation fully explaining what and where the
					changes need to be made. This should add any extra information
					that is important that has not already been explicitly stated.
Active User:		If a user/users has/have decided to take up the task, this
					would be where they provide their name to let others know who
					to contact in case they should need to.

A template:
<author name>: <brief explanation>
	<files concerned>
	
	<Longer explanation>
	
	<active user>

An example:
momotaur: Add comments
	File 1, File 2, File 3
	
	There are several functions in these files that either have badly
	worded comments, or no comments at all. Please fix.

Some extra guidelines:

Before posting in the tasklist, please make sure that you have introduced yourself
to a majority of the other editors of the current library, as it would be
inconvenient should someone want to discuss your task and not be able to reach you.
(Sadly, there is no dedicated place to do this, so you may be out of luck when it
comes to this file for now)

In the event that one would like to comment on or otherwise discuss a posted
task/suggestion, that should be done outside of the tasklist. The task list can
be edited, but posting a conversation will unnecessarily clutter things up, so
please don't do it.

If someone is working on your post and you decide to edit it, please let that
person know so they don't do unnecessary work.

Please do not edit a post that is not yours unless you have already discussed it
with the original author.
